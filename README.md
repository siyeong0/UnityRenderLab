# Unity Render Lab

**Unity Render Lab** is a collection of real-time rendering experiments in Unity.

It contains ...
- Ray tracing
- Marching cubes
- Ray marching
- BVH
## Ray tracing

An offline ray tracing implementation using accumulation techniques.
- Executed in the pixel shader.
- Supports spheres and polygonal mesh topology.

## Ray Marching

Implementation of ray marching using compute shaders. It includes various SDF-based shapes, and CSG operations.

## BVH
A custom Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) generator. 
It builds a very balanced tree using the Surface Area Heuristic (SAH) algorithm.
